## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 6 phases derived from 11 requirements. Conversion module built first (highest risk, best testability). DOCX integrates before EPUB (simpler, proving ground).
- [Roadmap]: CONV-01 mapped to Phase 5 (DOCX integration) as first end-to-end verification point. Phase 6 extends to EPUB.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research gap: `webp` crate error handling with unusual color spaces (grayscale, palette-indexed) needs verification during Phase 1.
- Research gap: `--gif-output` + `--convert` interaction -- GIFs routed to GIF output should be written as-is (unconverted). Confirm during Phase 3/4.
- EPUB parameter count growth: `epub::process_file` will have ~8 parameters after changes. May need config struct refactor in Phase 6.
